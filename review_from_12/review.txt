Group 12 review:

What you think they did well (and why)?

Your group has tried many good implementations and have some good
tuning as well. It's good how you have documented both what worked as well
as what didn't, which will make it easy to remember what should be 
incorporated in the final design. 

What you think they could improve on (and why)?

For a lot of the testing, it seemed like you did a lot of tuning simply
by modifiying parameters until you found something that "works." This 
seems to have been fine for now, but for finding the sizes that work
for the L1 and L2 caches, as you suggest doing for the future, it may
be more efficient to make some calculations to deterimine what the 
approximate size of a matrix that can fit in each cache.

Anything else you would like to add?

Looks good! Keep up the good work!
